description:
  The Way Things Are is meant to describe what I see as the starting point, 
  the base reality of this extraordinary, seemingly improbable existence we 
  have in this life-sustaining bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth. 
  When you remove the human-centric fabrications from your conception of 
  reality you are left with what can seem a terrifying nothingness. 
  That nothingness is all there is and it is mind-numbingly, exquisitely 
  beautify and awesome.
