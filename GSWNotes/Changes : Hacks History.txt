- Get rid of the # in front of all the headings.

I thought the # symbol in front of all the headings was aesthetically weird. I can get rid of it, but does it impair any functionality if I do?

in: /layouts/partials/textprocessing.html

Remove this code - commenting didn't seem to have effect??!?
<!--
{{/* Add jumpable anchors */}}
{{ $content = $content | replaceRE "(<h[1-9] id=\"([^\"]+)\">)(.+)(</h[1-9]>)" `<a href="#${2}">${1}<span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>${3}${4}</a>` }}
-->

When you remove this, the anchors in the TOC sections still work. But in in the original if you click on a heading, it floats to the top of the page - you lose this with this change. Right now I don't care.

Allow images to be resized to 30 or 50% and left and right justified so that text flows around them. Doing this means these images can't have captions.

To /assets/styles/custom.scss
Add:

img[src$='#right30']{
    float: right;
    margin-left: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 30%;
    position: relative;
}

img[src$='#right50']{
    float: right;
    margin-left: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 50%;
    position: relative;
}

img[src$='#left30']{
    float: left;
    margin-right: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 30%;
    position: relative;
}

img[src$='#left50']{
    float: left;
    margin-right: 15px;
    margin-bottom: 15px;
    border-radius: 10px;
    max-width: 50%;
    position: relative;
}
