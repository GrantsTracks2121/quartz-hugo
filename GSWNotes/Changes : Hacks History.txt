- Get rid of the # in front of all the headings.

I thought the # symbol in front of all the headings was aesthetically weird. I can get rid of it, but does it impair any functionality if I do?

in: layouts/partials/textprocessing.html

<!--
{{/* Add jumpable anchors */}}
{{ $content = $content | replaceRE "(<h[1-9] id=\"([^\"]+)\">)(.+)(</h[1-9]>)" `<a href="#${2}">${1}<span class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor"># </span>${3}${4}</a>` }}
