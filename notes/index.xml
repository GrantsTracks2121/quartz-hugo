The last rites of Bokononism Throughout the 127 short chapters of Kurt Vonnegut&amp;rsquo;s Cat&amp;rsquo;s Cradle our point of view bounces here, then there, and then suddenly, through the narrator&amp;rsquo;s eye&amp;rsquo;s, we&amp;rsquo;re witnessing the the last rites of &amp;ldquo;Papa&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; Monzano, the country&amp;rsquo;s reigning dictator.</description></item><item><title>The world isn't here for us to figure out</title><link>https://thewaythingsare.life/notes/The-world-isnt-here-for-us-to-figure-out/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thewaythingsare.life/notes/The-world-isnt-here-for-us-to-figure-out/</guid><description>The world isn&amp;rsquo;t here for us to figure out I was just watching the TV show &amp;ldquo;1883&amp;rdquo; and wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting anything semi-profound.

This is a term created by Vonnegut so the interpretation of it certainly has some wiggle room.</description></item><item><title>What the Earthrise picture actually looked like</title><link>https://thewaythingsare.life/notes/What-the-Earthrise-picture-actually-looked-like/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thewaythingsare.life/notes/What-the-Earthrise-picture-actually-looked-like/</guid><description>The &amp;ldquo;Earthrise&amp;rdquo; picture we&amp;rsquo;ve all seen has been altered for the sake of what humans expect to see when a heavenly body appears over a horizon.

Launched in September, 1968, the Russian Zond 5 was the first spacecraft to travel to the moon, loop behind (it didn&amp;rsquo;t orbit) and then return safely to the earth.</description></item></channel></rss>
