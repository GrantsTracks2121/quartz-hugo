Accessed 16 Jun. 2023.\n\nThe God of the Bible's Old Testament is described as a personal God.\n\n[This post](https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_1277.cfm) says:\n\n\u003eWhile most of the religions of the world believe that God is an impersonal being, the God who is revealed in the Bible is a personal God. This means that He has the characteristics of a person. A person can be defined as someone who is rational, conscious of his own being. This is how the Bible portrays God. He is a person, not an impersonal force.\n\nAfter listing exampled from the Bible that suggest God has personal attributes, the post provides this summary:\n\n\u003eThe Bible designates God as the living God. He is a rational being, conscious of His existence. As the living God He possesses the attributes of a person. For, among other things, He can love, express anger, and show mercy. The Bible also says that God has a will and an intellect. All of these characteristics are consistent with personhood. Furthermore, the Bible contrasts the personal living God with impersonal idols that are mere things.\n\n==This is a note from me to you.==\n\nIslam, by contrast, doesn't consider God to be a person but there's no other way to express the concept other than using pronouns. And Allah has no gender. Allah is the thing that is everything, unbounded by space and time and humans can't comprehend what Allah is.[^2] \n[^2]: \"Personal God.\" _Wikipedia_, Wikimedia Foundation, 5 Jun. 2023, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_god.

Each chapter acts like an almost random fragment of experience that as a reader one must work to stitch together into some kind of logical thread in order to glean meaning from it.\n\nSound familiar? It seems to me this is how we experience our reality.

This particular memory continues to help define what I consider is important to me.\n\nI believe I was in my late teens or early 20's when I said to a friend who knew me well:\n\n\u003e\"I would have been a minister if I'd only believed in God.\"\n\nWhen you read that, *you* understand it in the context of what \"be a minister\" means and what \"believing in God\" means to *you*. But what how did I understand those two key parts of that statement?\n\n### What does \"be a minister\" mean to me?\n\nI imagine for some that becoming a minister would be social calling, an urge  to follow a deeply felt value of altruism, the aim being to make the world a better place for others.\n\nFor me it was not about the altruistic, social aspect of religion. Rather it was about the intellectual pursuit of understanding what is going on in this existence. \n\nMy conception of \"being a minister\" was all about abstract ideas of searching for what power, energy, life force that creates and fosters our existence.\n\nThe idea of a \"Wizard of Oz\" figure, a \"He\" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeates the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense to me.\n\nA \"minister\" to me was a representative of religion and religion was in turn where the realm of the unseen, where the mystery behind \"what is going on\" resided. A minister was one who dealt in questions that that arose from that mysterious realm. A minister's vocation was to search and attempt to understand how our existence fits together, assuming there's any fitting together to be realized at all.\n\n### Whats did \"not believing in God\" mean?\n\nTo me, having grown up in a culture where Christianity was the pervasive religious belief system, \"God\" was the Christian god. When you thought of that God, you didn't think of a blade of grass in the back yard, or of the beauty of a sunset. This god was [a \"Personal God\"](notes/A%20Personal%20God.md) who was the \"Father\" of Jesus who was in turn the \"Son of God\", and therefore a human and a God at the same time. Finally, both \"Father\" and \"Son\" were somehow connected with the Holy Spirit in a \"trinity\".\n\nBut the idea of a \"Wizard of Oz\" figure, a \"He\" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeate the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense. This torpedoed the whole narrative for me. In short, I didn't - and don't - believe in the concept of a personal God.\n\n### That's what I meant then. What does it mean to me now?\n\nMore and more I realize that in a sense everyone is and should be their own minister. There is no underlying plan inherent in existence so there is no \"Oz\" behind the any curtains pulling the strings that determine the course of our lives. \n\nWithout a God, aka \"Wizard of Oz\", there's no hidden answer to discover. \n\nIn the end it all comes back to the fact that, as humans, all we can do is \n- **What?** *live* our lives (and notice live is a \"verb\" which means *doing* as opposed to merely *thinking about doing*),\n- **When?** You have no choice, it's right now, in this moment.\n\nIf your worldview involves the existence of a personal God, I welcome you to believe that if you so choose. But what I've just said still applies.\n\nThese last two \"What\" and \"When\" statements are true of everyone, no matter their worldview. You have simply decided that the belief structures you've adopted from a religion are the mental frameworks you will live your life, in this moment.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T23:42:59.868823775Z","tags":["üåøBudding","üìùNeeds_Editing"]},"/notes/Karass":{"title":"Karass","content":"## Karass\n\nFrom Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, a ** is a grouping of people from whom we've learned something that will help us proceed toward your *wampeter*, that thing you feel you've been created to get DONE in the world.\n\nWe almost never know who the members of your ** are or will be.

But the most striking thing to me is how elemental it is. There's sheer awe, and honest gratitude\nthroughout. If you strip away the human-concocted doctrines of organized religion, I believe this is what any human would feel and attempt to express about the opportunity to have lived a life, to existed at all.\n\nThe rites would conform to [[Bokononism is Nothing but Foma|Bokononism]], the native religion of the Republic of¬†San Lorenzo, a small, fictional island somewhere in the Caribbean.\n\nThe only person in the room who volunteered to administer the rites ^[1] was Dr. von Koenigswald, the attending doctor. When asked if he was a Bokononist, he a simply answered:\n [^1]: Although all islanders are Bokononists, the actual overt practice of Bokononism was banned on San Lorenzo and punishable by a gruesome death by being skewered by a giant hook. This is all very \"Vonnegut\".\n\n\u003e\"I agree with one Bokononist idea.

You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you'd like to get.\n\nThe majority of configuration can be found under `data/config.yaml`. An annotated example configuration is shown below.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n# The name to display in the footer\nname: Jacky Zhao\n\n# whether to globally show the table of contents on each page\n# this can be turned off on a per-page basis by adding this to the\n# front-matter of that note\nenableToc: true\n\n# whether to by-default open or close the table of contents on each page\nopenToc: false\n\n# whether to display on-hover link preview cards\nenableLinkPreview: true\n\n# whether to render titles for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockTitle: true \n\n# whether to render copy buttons for code blocks\nenableCodeBlockCopy: true \n\n# whether to render callouts\nenableCallouts: true\n\n# whether to try to process Latex\nenableLatex: true\n\n# whether to enable single-page-app style rendering\n# this prevents flashes of unstyled content and improves\n# smoothness of Quartz.

Ensure that code block titles are enabled in Quartz's configuration:\n\n    ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\n    enableCodeBlockTitle: true\n    ```\n\n2. Add the `title` attribute to the desired [code block\n   fence](https://gohugo.io/content-management/syntax-highlighting/#highlighting-in-code-fences):\n\n      ```markdown {linenos=false}\n       ```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\"}\n       enableCodeBlockTitle: true  # example from step 1\n       ```\n      ```\n\n**Note** that if `{title=\u003cmy-title\u003e}` is included, and code block titles are not\nenabled, no errors will occur, and the title attribute will be ignored.\n\n### HTML Favicons\nIf you would like to customize the favicons of your Quartz-based website, you \ncan add them to the `data/config.yaml` file. The **default** without any set \n`favicon` key is:\n\n```html {title=\"layouts/partials/head.html\", linenostart=15}\n\u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThe default can be overridden by defining a value to the `favicon` key in your \n`data/config.yaml` file. For example, here is a `List[Dictionary]` example format, which is\nequivalent to the default:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon:\n  - { rel: \"shortcut icon\", href: \"icon.png\", type: \"image/png\" }\n#  - { ... } # Repeat for each additional favicon you want to add\n```\n\nIn this format, the keys are identical to their HTML representations.\n\nIf you plan to add multiple favicons generated by a website (see list below), it\nmay be easier to define it as HTML. Here is an example which appends the \n**Apple touch icon** to Quartz's default favicon:\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/config.yaml\", linenos=false}\nfavicon: |\n  \u003clink rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"icon.png\" type=\"image/png\"\u003e\n  \u003clink rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" sizes=\"180x180\" href=\"/apple-touch-icon.png\"\u003e\n```\n\nThis second favicon will now be used as a web page icon when someone adds your \nwebpage to the home screen of their Apple device. If you are interested in more \ninformation about the current and past standards of favicons, you can read \n[this article](https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/the-essentials-of-favicons/).\n\n**Note** that all generated favicon paths, defined by the `href` \nattribute, are relative to the `static/` directory.\n\n### Graph View\nTo customize the Interactive Graph view, you can poke around `data/graphConfig.yaml`.\n\n```yaml {title=\"data/graphConfig.yaml\"}\n# if true, a Global Graph will be shown on home page with full width, no backlink.\n# A different set of Local Graphs will be shown on sub pages.\n# if false, Local Graph will be default on every page as usual\nenableGlobalGraph: false\n\n### Local Graph ###\nlocalGraph:\n    # whether automatically generate a legend\n    enableLegend: false\n    \n    # whether to allow dragging nodes in the graph\n    enableDrag: true\n    \n    # whether to allow zooming and panning the graph\n    enableZoom: true\n    \n    # how many neighbours of the current node to show (-1 is all nodes)\n    depth: 1\n    \n    # initial zoom factor of the graph\n    scale: 1.2\n    \n    # how strongly nodes should repel each other\n    repelForce: 2\n\n    # how strongly should nodes be attracted to the center of gravity\n    centerForce: 1\n\n    # what the default link length should be\n    linkDistance: 1\n    \n    # how big the node labels should be\n    fontSize: 0.6\n    \n    # scale at which to start fading the labes on nodes\n    opacityScale: 3\n\n### Global Graph ###\nglobalGraph:\n\t# same settings as above\n\n### For all graphs ###\n# colour specific nodes path off of their path\npaths:\n  - /moc: \"#4388cc\"\n```\n\n\n## Styling\nWant to go even more in-depth? You can add custom CSS styling and change existing colours through editing `assets/styles/custom.scss`. If you'd like to target specific parts of the site, you can add ids and classes to the HTML partials in `/layouts/partials`. \n\n### Partials\nPartials are what dictate what gets rendered to the page. Want to change how pages are styled and structured? You can edit the appropriate layout in `/layouts`.\n\nFor example, the structure of the home page can be edited through `/layouts/index.html`. To customize the footer, you can edit `/layouts/partials/footer.html`\n\nMore info about partials on [Hugo's website.](https://gohugo.io/templates/partials/)\n\nStill having problems? Checkout our [FAQ and Troubleshooting guide](notes/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Language Support\n[CJK + Latex Support (ÊµãËØï)](notes/CJK%20+%20Latex%20Support%20(ÊµãËØï).md) comes out of the box with Quartz.\n\nWant to support languages that read from right-to-left (like Arabic)? Hugo (and by proxy, Quartz) supports this natively.\n\nFollow the steps [Hugo provides here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/#configure-languages) and modify your `config.toml`\n\nFor example:\n\n```toml\ndefaultContentLanguage = 'ar'\n[languages]\n  [languages.ar]\n    languagedirection = 'rtl'\n    title = 'ŸÖÿØŸàŸÜÿ™Ÿä'\n    weight = 1\n```\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T23:42:59.868823775Z","tags":["setup"]},"/notes/docker":{"title":"Hosting with Docker","content":"\nIf you want to host Quartz on a machine without using a webpage hosting service, it may be easier to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) and follow the instructions below than to [install Quartz's dependencies manually](notes/preview-changes.md).\n## Hosting Quartz Locally\nYou can serve Quartz locally at `http://localhost:1313` with the following script, replacing `/path/to/quartz` with the \nactual path to your Quartz folder.\n\ndocker-compose.yml\n```\nservices:\n  quartz-hugo:\n    image: ghcr.io/jackyzha0/quartz:hugo\n    container_name: quartz-hugo\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/quartz:/quartz\n    ports:\n      - 1313:1313\n\n    # optional\n    environment:\n      - HUGO_BIND=0.0.0.0\n      - HUGO_BASEURL=http://localhost\n      - HUGO_PORT=1313\n      - HUGO_APPENDPORT=true\n      - HUGO_LIVERELOADPORT=-1\n```\n\nThen run with: `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory as your `docker-compose.yml` file.\n\nWhile the container is running, you can update the `quartz` fork with: `docker exec -it quartz-hugo make update`.\n\n## Exposing Your Container to the Internet\n\n### To Your Public IP Address with Port Forwarding (insecure)\n\nAssuming you are already familiar with [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) and [setting it up with your router model](https://portforward.com):\n\n1. You should set the environment variable `HUGO_BASEURL=http://your-public-ip` and then start your container.\n2. Set up port forwarding on your router from port `p` to `your-local-ip:1313`.\n3. You should now be able to access Quartz from outside your local network at `http://your-public-ip:p`.\n\nHowever, your HTTP connection will be unencrypted and **this method is not secure**.\n\n### To a Domain using Cloudflare Proxy\n\n1. Port forward 443 (HTTPS) from your machine.\n2. Buy a custom domain (say, `your-domain.com`) from [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/registrar/). Point a DNS A record from `your-domain.com` to your public IP address and enable the proxy.\n3. Set the environment variables `HUGO_BASEURL=https://your-domain.com`, `HUGO_PORT=443`, and `HUGO_APPENDPORT=false`. Change `1313:1313` to `443:443` for the `ports` in `docker-compose.yml`.\n4. Spin up your Quartz container and enjoy it at `https://your-domain.com`!\n\n### To a Domain using a Reverse Proxy\n\nIf you want to serve more than just Quartz to the internet on this machine (or don't want to use the Cloudflare registrar and proxy), you should follow the steps in the section above (as appropriate) and also set up a reverse proxy, like [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik). Be sure to configure your TLS certificates too!\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-18T23:42:59.868823775Z","tags":["setup"]}}
