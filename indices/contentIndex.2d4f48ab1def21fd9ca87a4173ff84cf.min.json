{"/":{"title":"The Way Things Are","content":"[Tea Ceremony at a Department Store](notes/Tea%20Ceremony%20at%20a%20Department%20Store/index.md)\n\nThis is the ***home*** page - and *only* page so far - of *The Way Things Are*, a site that I intend to be a consistently-tended digital garden. What is a \"digital garden,\" you might ask.\n\nI'll let Anne-Laure Le Cunff provide a digital gardens. [a summary description of digital gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).\n\n### About the Site Title\n ![Earthrise taken from Apollo 8](notes/images/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg#right50)I hasten to point out I don't claim to know exactly \"the way things are\" in the sense of \"the way things all fit together\". Goodness no. \n\n\"The way things are\" is meant to describe what I see as the starting point, the base reality of this extraordinary, seemingly improbable existence we have in this life-sustaining bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth.\n\nIn short, ==***the starting point*** is that there is no inherent purpose, no inherent meaning in our existence apart from what we make of it.== Does that sound bleak to you, nihilistic even? Of course it might because we yearn for purpose and for meaning. We hope that it's somewhere to be found because a sense of purpose and meaning makes us more comfortable while we navigate the chaos of our lives.\n\nI've come to conclude that purpose and meaning aren't objects to be ==found==; rather they are ==made== while living one's life and pursuing activities that bring one personal growth and joy. It's as simple as that.\n\nThe point here is it doesn't come \"ready-made\" for us to simply adopt; rather we need to ***construct*** it ourselves with the help of our family, our community, our culture and our species.\n\nAnd it is wonderful what we can make of it.\n\n\u003e‚ÄúAt the back of our brain, there is a forgotten blaze or burst of astonishment at our own existence. The object of the artistic and spiritual life is to dig for this submerged sunrise of wonder.‚Äù\n\n\n![](notes/images/foamy-moo.png)\n\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-23T22:15:48.042932331Z","tags":["üå±Seedling","üßπNeeds_Editing"]},"/notes/A-Personal-God":{"title":"Definition of Personal God","content":"\u003eA personal god, or personal goddess, is a deity who can be related to as a person instead of as an impersonal force, such as the Absolute.[^1]\n\n[^1]:\"Personal God.\" _Wikipedia_, Wikimedia Foundation, 5 Jun. 2023, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_god. Accessed 16 Jun. 2023.\n\nThe God of the Bible's Old Testament is described as a personal God.\n\n[This post](https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_1277.cfm) says:\n\n\u003eWhile most of the religions of the world believe that God is an impersonal being, the God who is revealed in the Bible is a personal God. This means that He has the characteristics of a person. A person can be defined as someone who is rational, conscious of his own being. This is how the Bible portrays God. He is a person, not an impersonal force.\n\nAfter listing exampled from the Bible that suggest God has personal attributes, the post provides this summary:\n\n\u003eThe Bible designates God as the living God. He is a rational being, conscious of His existence. As the living God He possesses the attributes of a person. For, among other things, He can love, express anger, and show mercy. The Bible also says that God has a will and an intellect. All of these characteristics are consistent with personhood. Furthermore, the Bible contrasts the personal living God with impersonal idols that are mere things.\n\nIslam, by contrast, doesn't consider God to be a person but there's no other way to express the concept other than using pronouns. And Allah has no gender. Allah is the thing that is everything, unbounded by space and time and humans can't comprehend what Allah is.[^2] \n[^2]: \"Personal God.\" _Wikipedia_, Wikimedia Foundation, 5 Jun. 2023, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_god.

We fabricate to make ourselves feel like we live in a some version of the world that makes some kind of sense. \n\nIt's in our nature, as Vonnegut's little poem elsewhere in Cat's Cradle chimes:\n\n\u003e\"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;  \n\u003eMan got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'  \n\u003eTiger got to sleep, bird got to land;  \n\u003eMan got to tell himself he understand.\" ¬† \n\u003e--Book of Bokonon\n\nReading Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle* has a certain \"super-ball-bouncing-around-in-a-tiny-room\" feel to it; in fact, this relatively short book has 127 chapters. Each chapter acts like a random fragment of experience that as a reader one must work to stitch together into some kind of logical thread in order to glean meaning from it.\n\nSound familiar? It seems to me this is how we experience our reality. We experience bits and pieces of reality, most of which is loaded with culturally-imbued meanings, and we stitch together a narrative from them and that way *we get to tell ourselves we understand*.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-23T22:15:48.046932475Z","tags":["üå±Seedling","üßπNeeds_Editing"]},"/notes/Cats-Cradle-by-Kurt-Vonnegut":{"title":"Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut","content":"\n‚ü∞  [[Resources]]\n\n![](notes/images/catscradlecover.png#right50)\nCat's Cradle was Kurt Vonnegut's fourth novel.\n\n\u003e...it was first published in 1963, exploring and satirizing issues of science, technology, the purpose of religion, and the arms race, often through the use of morbid humor.[^1]\n\n[^1]:\"Cat's Cradle.\" _Wikipedia_, Wikimedia Foundation, 19 May 2023, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_Cradle.

Rather it was about the intellectual pursuit of understanding what is going on in this existence. \n\nMy conception of \"being a minister\" was all about abstract ideas of searching for what power, energy, life force that creates and fosters our existence.\n\nThe idea of a \"Wizard of Oz\" figure, a \"He\" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeates the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense to me.\n\nA \"minister\" to me was a representative of religion and religion was in turn where the realm of the unseen, where the mystery behind \"what is going on\" resided. A minister was one who dealt in questions that that arose from that mysterious realm. A minister's vocation was to search and attempt to understand how our existence fits together, assuming there's any fitting together to be realized at all.\n\n### Whats did \"not believing in God\" mean?\n\nTo me, having grown up in a culture where Christianity was the pervasive religious belief system, \"God\" was the Christian god. When you thought of that God, you didn't think of a blade of grass in the back yard, or of the beauty of a sunset. This god was [a \"Personal God\"](notes/A%20Personal%20God.md) who was the \"Father\" of Jesus who was in turn the \"Son of God\", and therefore a human and a God at the same time. Finally, both \"Father\" and \"Son\" were somehow connected with the Holy Spirit in a \"trinity\".\n\nBut the idea of a \"Wizard of Oz\" figure, a \"He\" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeate the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense. This torpedoed the whole narrative for me. In short, I didn't - and don't - believe in the concept of a personal God.\n\n### That's what I meant then. What does it mean to me now?\n\nMore and more I realize that in a sense everyone is and should be their own minister. There is no underlying plan inherent in existence so there is no \"Oz\" behind the any curtains pulling the strings that determine the course of our lives. \n\nWithout a God, aka \"Wizard of Oz\", there's no hidden answer to discover. \n\nIn the end it all comes back to the fact that, as humans, all we can do is \n- **What?** *live* our lives (and notice live is a \"verb\" which means *doing* as opposed to merely *thinking about doing*),\n- **When?** You have no choice, it's right now, in this moment.\n\nIf your worldview involves the existence of a personal God, I welcome you to believe that if you so choose. But what I've just said still applies.\n\nThese last two \"What\" and \"When\" statements are true of everyone, no matter their worldview. You have simply decided that the belief structures you've adopted from a religion are the mental frameworks you will live your life, in this moment.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-23T22:15:48.046932475Z","tags":["üåøBudding","üìùNeeds_Editing"]},"/notes/Karass":{"title":"Karass","content":"## Karass\n\nFrom Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, a ** is a grouping of people from whom we've learned something that will help us proceed toward your *wampeter*, that thing you feel you've been created to get DONE in the world.\n\nWe almost never know who the members of your ** are or will be.

A friend and I got caught attempting to scale the fence of a compound where a bunch of Caterpillar equipment was stored.\n\nNow, I'm not saying I was blameless in what we were trying to do; I shoulder just as much blame as my friend, but you have to know that this friend was new to town and in short he was terrible influence on me, a real \"bad apple\" as they say.\n\nSo we're caught climbing the fence with a bellowing voice behind us \"Hey, you kids! What are you doing there?!!\" Of course we stopped climbing and had no choice but to face the music. \n\nI though I recognized the man as being a neighbour who lived down the street from me, but that didn't really influence me much when he asked our names. I immediately offered my name. \n\nHe turned to my friend and he also immediately blurted out, \"Ken Skove\".  I was stunned, because this was ***not*** his real name. \n\nYou see when you grow up in a small town it not like *everyone* knows *everyone*, but it's almost true that they do. The idea of giving a false name to someone who asked simply didn't enter my mind. This friend was relatively new in town and maybe that's what gave him the courage to simply lie.\n\nThe man who caught us must have given us some kind of scolding after that and I don't remember anything else ever coming of this incident in terms of punishment, so the man must not have followed up on it.\n\nWhat I took away from that experience was the possibility of using that name \"Ken Skove\" as a pseudonym. It worked wonders for my friend that day; maybe it could do the same for me when I needed a fake name to use later in life.\n\nThat's why you see the name on the silly \"The Adventures of Foamy\" book that I made during graduate school, years later. \n\n![](notes/images/gswimgs141.jpg)\n\nThere's more about what this tiny tome is all about [here](notes/Foamy%20-%20The%20Rabid%20Dog.md) if you're interested.\n","lastmodified":"2023-06-23T22:15:48.046932475Z","tags":["üåøBudding","üßπNeeds_Editing"]},"/notes/Old-style-book-printing-and-binding-process":{"title":"Old-style book printing and binding process","content":"While studying English Literature, I took a course in grad school that taught us about how books were printed and bound in the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nI struggle to remember anything about the content of the course, but I do remember practicing the complicated page layout that was necessary to make successive pages appear in order in the book.
