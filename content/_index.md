## The Way Things Are

This is the ***home*** page - and *only* page so far - of *The Way Things Are*.

 ![Earthrise taken from Apollo 8](notes/images/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg#right50)I hasten to point out I don't claim to know exactly the way things are in the sense of "the way things all fit together", or this how things are an no other way, period, end of discussion. Goodness no. 

"The way things are" is meant to describe what I see as the starting point of this extraordinary, seemingly improbable existence we have in this life-sustaining bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth.

***The starting point*** is that there is no inherent purpose, no inherent meaning in our existence apart from what we make of it. Does that sound bleak to you? Of course it might because we yearn for purpose and for meaning. It's what makes our life worth living. The point here is it doesn't come "ready-made" for us to simply adopt; rather we need to ***construct*** it ourselves with the help of our family, our community, our culture and our species.

And it is wonderful what we can make of it.
