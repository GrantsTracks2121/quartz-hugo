This is the ***home*** page - and *only* page so far - of *The Way Things Are*, a site that I intend to be a consistently-tended digital garden. What is a "digital garden," you might ask.

I'll let Anne-Laure Le Cunff provide a digital gardens. [a summary description of digital gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).

### About the Site Title
 ![Earthrise taken from Apollo 8](notes/images/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg#right50 "Earthrise - taken by William Anders  during Apollo 8")I hasten to point out I don't claim to know exactly "the way things are" in the sense of "the way things all fit together". Goodness no. 

"The Way Things Are" is meant to describe what I see as the starting point, the base reality of this extraordinary, seemingly improbable existence we have in this life-sustaining bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth. When you remove the human-centric fabrications from your conception of reality you are left with what can seem a terrifying nothingness. That nothingness is all there is and it is mind-numbingly, exquisitely beautify and awesome.

In short, ***the starting point*** is that there is no inherent purpose, no inherent meaning in our existence apart from what we make of it. Does that sound bleak to you, nihilistic even? Of course it might because we yearn for purpose and for meaning. We hope that it's somewhere to be found because a sense of purpose and meaning makes us more comfortable while we navigate the chaos of our lives.

I've come to conclude that purpose and meaning aren't objects to be ==found==; rather they are ==made== while living one's life and pursuing activities that bring one personal growth and joy. It's as simple as that.

>The point here is it doesn't come "ready-made" for us to simply adopt; rather we need to ***construct*** it ourselves with the help of our family, our community, our culture and our species.

And it is wonderful what we can make of it.

>At the back of our brain, there is a forgotten blaze or burst of astonishment at our own existence. The object of the artistic and spiritual life is to dig for this submerged sunrise of wonder.
