This is the ***home*** page - and *only* page so far - of *The Way Things Are*, a site that I intend to be a consistently-tended digital garden. What is a "digital garden," you might ask.

I'll let Anne-Laure Le Cunff provide a digital gardens. [a summary description of digital gardens](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up).

### About the Site Title
 ![Earthrise taken from Apollo 8](notes/images/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg#right50)I hasten to point out I don't claim to know exactly "the way things are" in the sense of "the way things all fit together". Goodness no. 

"The way things are" is meant to describe what I see as the starting point, the base reality of this extraordinary, seemingly improbable existence we have in this life-sustaining bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth.

In short, ==***the starting point*** is that there is no inherent purpose, no inherent meaning in our existence apart from what we make of it.== Does that sound bleak to you, nihilistic even? Of course it might because we yearn for purpose and for meaning. We hope that it's somewhere to be found because a sense of purpose and meaning makes us more comfortable while we navigate the chaos of our lives.

I've come to conclude that purpose and meaning aren't objects to be ==found==; rather they are ==made== while living one's life and pursuing activities that bring one personal growth and joy. It's as simple as that.

The point here is it doesn't come "ready-made" for us to simply adopt; rather we need to ***construct*** it ourselves with the help of our family, our community, our culture and our species.

And it is wonderful what we can make of it.

>At the back of our brain, there is a forgotten blaze or burst of astonishment at our own existence. The object of the artistic and spiritual life is to dig for this submerged sunrise of wonder.
