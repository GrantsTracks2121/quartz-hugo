## The Way Things Are
 ![Earthrise taken from Apollo 8](notes/images/NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg#right50)
This is the home page of The Way Things Are.

And already I hasten to point out I ***don't*** claim to know exactly the way things are. The title is meant to describe what I see as the starting point of existence, this life we have in this life-giving bubble in the vacuum of space we call earth.

The starting point is that there is no purpose, no meaning inherent in our existence apart from what we make of it.

And it is wonderful what we can make of it.
