[During the time I worked in Japan](notes/Teaching%20English%20in%20Japan.md) I had the opportunity to attend a tea ceremony performed by one of my co-workers, Yumi H. [^1] 
[^1]:This was Yumi's family name started with "H" at the time. She's no doubt married now and has acquired a different family name. 

The ceremony took place in a space a department store in Matsuyama. I remember it being in the "Sogo" department store, but I could be wrong. Canadians could substitute "Eaton's" or the now defunct "Sears" for "department store" to get a sense of the setting: a large department store which is quite different from the rustic tea houses that one expects tea ceremonies to be held.

- everyday conception of Yumi - perennially smiling, laughing with frequent exclamations of „Åä„ÇÇ„Åó„Çç„ÅÑÔºÅ (omoshiroi;  loose translation: "That's so funny!") to cap off her reaction to something that was amusing.
- compare that everyday Yumi I know to her performing the exacting flow of movements required in strict procedure of the tea ceremony.
- she studied Aikido as well. 
- I don't know about Aikido, but I have experience learning TaeKwondo and it's forms, in Japanese, *kata*. One focuses on the form, what is required in the moment according to the teaching. You are less yourself than you are human following the form during that time.
