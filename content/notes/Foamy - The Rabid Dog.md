I wasn't a serial buyer of *National Lampoon*. During my high school days I do remember flipping through it at the book store / news stand in our small town, but it was a few years later, during my university years, when I found Foamy, The Rabid Dog in the Timberland Tales cartoon by B.K. Taylor in the magazine.

I idea of a family having a rabid dog as a pet was so ridiculously funny to me. Foamy became a hero but probably more importantly he became a way to obtain free beer.

I'll explain.

During my first year of grad school, I took a course that taught us all about how books were made by the first printing presses. 

Since the pages of a book were printed on large sheets of paper, the individual pages needed to be positioned in such a way that they'd appear in order once that large sheet was folded many times order so it could be bound in the book.  If you're interested learning a little more about this, [see this page about the old-style printing and binding process.](notes/Old-style%20book%20printing%20and%20binding%20process.md) [[see this page about the old-style printing and binding.|]]

One learns by doing, so to learn the process I practiced making my own little books by arranging individual pages in the layout needed to produce a book once the large sheet of multiple pages was folded in just the right way.

The result of that practice was *The Adventures of Foamy*.

You might notice that I used the pen name "Ken Skove". [[notes/Ken Skove]]. It's a name I've used often when signing up for internet services that I'd rather not give my real name to. 

For fun I'd try to sell these books for one beer each
