## Bokononism is Nothing but Foma

In Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, Bokononism is the fictional native religion of The Republic ofÂ San Lorenzo, a small, fictional island somewhere in the Caribbean. 

Bokononism is plainly described in the book as being nothing but *foma* - Vonnegut's invented term explained in the book variously as meaning "a pack of comforting lies", "harmless untruths" or "a useful and harmless sort of horseshit".

In place of the word "lies" - which to me means willingly representing a truth that is known - I'd substitute "fabrications" which are mental constructs that make up a worldview when a truth is impossible to know.

*Foma* are the stories we tell ourselves to make ourselves believe that there's order, structure, predictability in a reality that is actually chaotic, unpredictable, and inertly caring.

Telling ourselves comforting fabrications is what we do as humans. We fabricate to make ourselves feel like we live in a some version of the world that makes some kind of sense. 

It's in our nature, as Vonnegut's little poem elsewhere in Cat's Cradle chimes:

>"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly;  
>Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?'  
>Tiger got to sleep, bird got to land;  
>Man got to tell himself he understand." Â  
>--Book of Bokonon

Reading Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle* has a certain "super-ball-bouncing-around-in-a-tiny-room" feel to it; in fact, this relatively short book has 127 chapters. Each chapter acts like an almost random fragment of experience that as a reader one must work to stitch together into some kind of logical thread in order to glean meaning from it.

Sound familiar? It seems to me this is how we experience our reality. We experience bits and pieces of reality, most of which is loaded with meanings our culture has imbued us witih, and we stitch together a narrative from it: *we got to tell ourselves we understand*.
