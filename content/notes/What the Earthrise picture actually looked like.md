The "Earthrise" picture we've all seen has been altered for the sake of what humans expect to see when a heavenly body appears over a horizon. Daily, for the entire time the human race has existed, we see the sun and the moon rise from earth's horizon and fall behind it. 

If you stop and think about it, because the Apollo 8 capsule orbiting from the far side of the moon, travelling on the plane of the equator, the earth would look like this when it came into view:

It wasn't orbiting from the moon's south pole to north pole, in which case the earth would truly seem to appear rise from the horizon like we're used to on earth.

There's no big revelation here, no conspiracy to hide some "truth" or any such thing.

Since there's no up / down orientation in space and since humans ***expect*** heavenly bodies to rise from a horizontal horizon, the image was rotated to match our human expectations.

When you compare the "standard" Earthrise picture with the actual original picture. The rotated version has much more of an impact on our consciousness. The focus leaves the moon's surface as it becomes a "ground" that we simply habitually ignore in favour of the heavenly body floating in the sky. Oriented this way, the earth is the obviously subject of the photo.

That's us there. Suspended in the vacuum of space, everything you've ever known, all the joy, beauty, heartbreak and viciousness that humans have brought about is contained in that sphere.
