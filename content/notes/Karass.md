## Karass

From Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, a ** is a grouping of people from whom we've learned something that will help us proceed toward your *wampeter*, that thing you feel you've been created to get DONE in the world.

We almost never know who the members of your ** are or will be. It could be family members, maybe a friend, or perhaps a stranger you see on the street who inspires you to do something unexpected. 

These people can serve to be positive or negative examples for you to learn from. We don't really need to be conscious of these people, but something they say or do can teach or influence us: some causing us to careen into a different path in life. 

[Here are the explanations straight from the book.](https://catscradle.neocities.org/chapter-24.html)
