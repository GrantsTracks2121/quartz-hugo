From Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, a *Wampeter* **is something that is currently serving as the vector or focus for your existence.**

This is a term created by Vonnegut so the interpretation of it certainly has some wiggle room.

To my mind, it could also be a nagging question, an illogical urge, a self-expectation that you're here in this existence to get something DONE. What is it? And what forces are revolving around it in order to support it?

>A  *wampeter* is the pivot of a karass. No *karass* is without a *wampeter*, Bokonon tells us, just as no wheel is without a hub. [^1]

[^1]: Kurt Vonnegut, *Cat's Cradle*, Chapter 24.

Everyone has this question lurking in the back of their brains and it occasionally bubbles to the fore to be confronted.

>Anything can be aÂ *wampeter*: a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail.[^2]

[^2]: Kurt Vonnegut, *Cat's Cradle*, Chapter 24.

*Wampeter*s wax and wane:

 >At any given time a karass actually has two *wampeters*â€”one waxing in importance, one waning.
