## Wampeter

From Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle*, a ** is something that is currently serving as the vector or focus for your existence. 

To my mind it could also be a nagging question, an illogical urge, a self-expectation that you're here in this existence to get something DONE. What is it? And what forces are revolving around it in order to support it?

>A  is the pivot of a karass. No karass is without a , Bokonon tells us, just as no wheel is without a hub. [^1]

[^1]: Kurt Vonnegut, *Cat's Cradle*, Chapter 24.

Everyone has this this question lurking in the back of their brains and it occasionally bubbles up to the fore to be confronted.

>Anything can be aÂ __: a tree, a rock, an animal, an idea, a book, a melody, the Holy Grail.[^2]

[^2]: Kurt Vonnegut, *Cat's Cradle*, Chapter 24.

s wax and wane:

 >At any given time a karass actually has two sâ€”one waxing in importance, one waning.
