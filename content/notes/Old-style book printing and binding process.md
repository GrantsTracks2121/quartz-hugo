While studying English Literature, I took a course in grad school that taught us about how books were printed and bound in the 17th and 18th centuries.

I struggle to remember anything about the content of the course, but I do remember practicing the complicated page layout that was necessary to make successive pages appear in order in the book. I learn the process, I needed to create my own little book to practice with and the practicing brought about [*The Adventures of Foamy](notes/Foamy%20-%20The%20Rabid%20Dog.md).

Here's a brief YouTube Video that give you an idea of the book printing and binding process.
