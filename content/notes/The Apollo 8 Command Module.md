I personally had the thrill of being able to get very close to the Apollo 8 Command Module on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

I say "get very close to" because the craft is understandably protected behind a barrier of plexiglass.

While attending a work-related conference in Chicago, my co-worker and I made a point of visiting the marvelous museum. Unfortunately it was extremely crowded and the hustle and bustle gradually become oppressive. My co-worker bailed early and said he was catching the bus back to the hotel.

I completely understood, but I knew the Apollo 8 Command Module was in the building and it was the "holy grail" that I felt compelled to seek out despite the crowded building.

I'm so glad I visited the spacecraft and when up close to it, I remember thinking this thing, right here in front of me, circled the moon. It made a lasting impression on me.

I have to admit I routinely scoff at the the idea of people making pilgrimages to holy sites just to be closer to some personal artifact that is said to be associated with Saint or the like. This was not a "holy" site. The astronauts who traveled in this capsule were not saints; rather they were highly trained men with, usually with temperaments of being calm under extra-ordinary pressure.

  âŸ±%%I'm kind of losing the plot here, but I want to compare the impact of being close to a man-made thing that actually traveled in space%% 
 
I gained a sense of what those pilgrims feel at the end of their journey because it was such a thrill to be so close to something real, man-made that had traveled in space, circled the moon, and returned to earth sheilding three men from the fireball created by flying at ridiculous speeds through Earth's atmosphere. leaving it a charred hunk of metal
