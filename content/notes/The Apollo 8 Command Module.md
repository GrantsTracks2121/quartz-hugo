I personally had the thrill of being able to get very close to the Apollo 8 Command Module on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.

I say "get very close to" because the craft is understandably behind a barrier of plexiglass.

While attending a work-related conference in Chicago, my co-worker and I made a point of visiting the marvelous museum. Unfortunately it was crowded and to us the hustle and bustle began to get oppressive. He bailed early and said he was catching the bus back to the hotel.

I completely understood, but I knew the Apollo 8 Command Module was in the building and it was the "holy grail" that I felt compelled to seek out despite the crowded building.

I'm so glad I visited the spacecraft and when up close to it, I remember thinking this thing, right here in front of me, circled the moon. It made a lasting impression on me.
