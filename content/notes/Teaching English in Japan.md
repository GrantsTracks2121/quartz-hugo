I worked as an English conversation teacher in Matsuyama, Japan from 1985 to 1987. I travelled to Japan from Canada to look for a teaching position. Canadian got a three month tourist visa when entering Japan so my thinking was that I'd look for a job and if I didn't find one, at least I'd have had a nice trip in Japan
