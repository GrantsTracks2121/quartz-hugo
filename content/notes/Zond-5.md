The first earthlings that have the distinction to travel to the moon were not humans, rather a collection of tortoises, single-celled green algae, bacterial and assorted plants and fruit. 

Launched in September, 1968, the Russian Zond 5 was the first spacecraft to travel to the moon, loop behind (it didn't orbit) and then return safely to the earth. Although initial plans were for a manned mission, the previous Zond missions were fraught with numerous launch failures. It was decided that a payload of living things from the earth was the safer option when weighed against the negative propaganda of another unsuccessful flight. [^1]

Two Russian tortoises (_**Testudo horsfieldii**_) were secured in the capsule without food or water so that they could be compared with control subjects, tortoises on earth who were similarly starved.

After returning to earth "It was reported, the turtles had lost 10 per cent of their body weight but remained active and showed no loss of appetite."[^2] [^2]:https://www.republicworld.com/technology-news/science/ussr-launched-zond-5-spaceship-on-this-day-in-1968.html
