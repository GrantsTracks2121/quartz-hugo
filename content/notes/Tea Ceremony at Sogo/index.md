[During the time I worked in Japan](notes/Teaching%20English%20in%20Japan.md) I had the opportunity to attend a tea ceremony performed by one of my co-workers, Yumi Horiuchi. The ceremony took place in a space a Sogo Department store. For Canadians you could substitute "Eaton's" or the now defunct "Sears" for "Sogo" to get a sense of the setting.

- everyday conception of Yumi - perennially smiling, laughing with frequent exclamations of „Åä„ÇÇ„Åó„Çç„ÅÑÔºÅ (omoshiroi;  loose translation: "That's so funny!") to cap off her reaction to something that was amusing.
- compare that everyday Yumi I know to her performing the exacting flow of movements required in strict procedure of the tea ceremony.
- she studied Aikido as well. 
- I don't know about Aikido, but I have experience learning TaeKwondo and it's forms, in Japanese, *kata*. One focuses on the form, what is required in the moment according to the teaching. You are less yourself than you are human following the form during that time.
