When I was in what we called Junior High School, sometime during grades 7 or 8. A friend and I got caught attempting to scale the fence of a compound where a bunch of Caterpillar equipment was parked. Talk about a unfair magnet for young boys! Building a fence there wasn't going to stop the primal urge we had to explore that cool-looking equipment.

Now, I'm not saying I was blameless in what we were trying to do; I shoulder just as much blame as my friend, but you have to know that this friend was new to town and, in short, he was terrible influence on me, a real "bad apple" as they say.

So we're caught climbing the fence with a bellowing voice behind us "Hey, you kids! What are you doing there?!!" Of course we stopped climbing and had no choice but to face the music. 

I though I recognized the man who had caught us as being a neighbour who lived down the street from me, but that didn't really influence me much when he asked our names. I immediately offered my actual, real name. 

The man then turned to my friend, asked his name and the friend immediately blurted out, "Ken Skove".  I was stunned, because this was ***not*** his real name. Who the hell is "Ken Skove?"

You see when you grow up in a small town it not like *everyone* knows *everyone*, but it's almost true that they do. The idea of giving a false name to someone who asked simply didn't enter my mind. This friend was relatively new in town and maybe that's what gave him the courage to simply lie.

The man who caught us must have given us some kind of scolding after that and I don't remember anything else ever coming of this incident in terms of punishment, so he must not have followed up on it.

What I took away from that experience was the possibility of using that name "Ken Skove" as a pseudonym. It worked wonders for my friend that day, so it obviously had **power**. I thought maybe it could do the same for me when I needed a fake name to use later in life.

That's why you see the name on the silly "The Adventures of Foamy" book that I made during graduate school, years later.
