## I would have been a minister if I'd only believed in God

This is an example of what I'd call a "sticky memory". It comes up again and again throughout my life. This particular memory continues to help define what I consider important to me.

I believe I was in my late teens or early 20's when I said to a friend who knew me well:

>"I would have been a minister if I'd only believed in God."

When you read that, *you* understand it in the context of what "be a minister" means and what "believing in God" means to *you*. But what how did I understand those two key parts of that statement?

### What does "be a minister" mean to me?

I imagine for some that becoming a minister would be social calling, an urge  to follow a deeply felt value of altruism, the aim being to make the world a better place for others.

For me it was not about the altruistic, social aspect of religion. Rather it was about the intellectual pursuit of understanding what is going on in this existence. 

My conception of "being a minister" was all about abstract ideas of searching for what's behind the curtain that forms our existence. What does that "Wizard of Oz" figure - or whatever you want to call the energy, the power, the life force that creates and fosters our existence.

The idea of a "Wizard of Oz" figure, a "He" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeate the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense.

A "minister" to me was a representative of religion and religion was in turn where the realm of the unseen, where the mystery behind "what is going on" resided. A minister was one who dealt in that mysterious realm, whose vocation it was to search and attempt to understand how our existence fits together - assuming there's any fitting together to be realized at all.

### What's did not believing in God mean?

To me, having grown up in a culture where Christianity was the pervasive religious belief system, "God" was the Christian god. When you thought of that God, you didn't think of a blade of grass in the back yard, or of the beauty of a sunset. This god was a personal God  %%Need link to definition or footnote%% who was the "father" of Jesus who was the "Son of God" and both were somehow connected with the Holy Ghost in a "trinity". The Holy Ghost wasn't mentioned all that much, now that I think of it. He just seemed to show up for board meetings and presumably spent the rest of his time (which wouldn't even be a thing if you were the Holy Ghost) maybe playing golf.

But the idea of a "Wizard of Oz" figure, a "He" God with the human attributes of jealousy, anger, vengefulness, all of which permeate the primarily Old Testament books of the Bible, seemed like sheer nonsense. In short, I didn't - and don't - believe in the concept of a [[notes/Definition of Personal God|"personal God"]].

### Thats what I meant. What does it mean to me now?
More and more I realize that everyone is and should be their own minister. There is no underlying plan inherent in existence  %%need link here to where this idea is expanded%% so there is no "Oz" behind the any curtains pulling the strings that determine the course of our lives. 

Without a God, aka "Wizard of Oz", there's no hidden answer to discover. 

In the end it all comes back to the fact that, as humans, all we can do is 
- **What?** *live* our lives (and notice live is a "verb" which means *doing* as opposed to merely *thinking about doing*),
- **When?** You have no choice, it's right now, in this moment.

If your worldview involves the existence of a personal God, well, that is immaterial. These last two statements are true of everyone, no matter their worldview. You have simply decided that the belief structures you've adopted from a religion are the mental frameworks you will live your life, in this moment.
