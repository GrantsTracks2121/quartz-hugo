## The world isn't here for us to figure out
I was just watching the TV show "1883" and wasn't expecting anything semi-profound. But the writing of narration is good.

==At the end of episode 3 the young girl narrating foreshadows bad things happening.==

Looking back, there were two journeys.
One was filled with danger, and death and despair,
the other adventure and wonder.

I was on the latter, and I loved it.
I didn't know enough to know they would collide
I didn't know enough to know how cruel and uncaring the world can be.

The world doesn't care if you die.
It would listen to your screams.
If you bleed on the ground, the ground will drink it.
It doesn't care that you're cut.

I told myself when I meet God it will be the first thing I ask him: why make a world of such wonder then fill it with monsters?
Why make flowers and then snakes to hide beneath them?
What purpose does the tornado serve?

The it hit me: he didn't make it for us.

==what struck me when I heard this is if the world wasn't made for us - another way to express the conclusion I've come to: that we are simply part of the flow of the never-ending waxing and waning of a force that does nothing but create and destroy. It is that and nothing else - any sense we try to make of it is firmly planted in our minds and not the actual world we're part of. It's all merely a veneer, a framework of thought we construct to make our existence seem more stable. The world just is and doesn't have the capacity to invite us to figure it out. There's now figuring out to do.==
