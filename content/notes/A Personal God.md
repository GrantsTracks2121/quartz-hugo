## Definition of "Personal God"

>A personal god, or personal goddess, is a deity who can be related to as a person instead of as an impersonal force, such as the Absolute.[^1]

The God of the Bible's Old Testament is described as a personal God.

[This post](https://www.blueletterbible.org/faq/don_stewart/don_stewart_1277.cfm) says:

>While most of the religions of the world believe that God is an impersonal being, the God who is revealed in the Bible is a personal God. This means that He has the characteristics of a person. A person can be defined as someone who is rational, conscious of his own being. This is how the Bible portrays God. He is a person, not an impersonal force.

Islam, by contrast, doesn't consider God to be a person but there's no other way to express the concept other than using pronouns. And Allah has no gender. Allah is the thing that is everything, unbounded by space and time and humans can't comprehend what Allah is.[^2]
