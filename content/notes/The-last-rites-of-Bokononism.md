## The last rites of Bokononism

Throughout the 127 short chapters of Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle* our point of view bounces here, then there, and then suddenly, through the narrator's eye's, we're witnessing the the last rites of "Papa'' Monzano, the country's reigning dictator.

To me, these "rites" in the face of finality to be one of the most genuine, pure, and honest expressions of sheer gratitude and awe that I've come across. 

The context of the expressions is playful and fun. But the most striking thing to me is how elemental it is. There's sheer awe, and honest gratitude
throughout. If you strip away the human-concocted doctrines of organized religion, I believe this is what any human would feel and attempt to express about the opportunity to have lived a life, to existed at all.

The rites would conform to [[Bokononism is Nothing but Foma|Bokononism]], the native religion of the Republic ofÂ San Lorenzo, a small, fictional island somewhere in the Caribbean.

The only person in the room who volunteered to administer the rites ^[1] was Dr. von Koenigswald, the attending doctor. When asked if he was a Bokononist, he a simply answered:
 [^1]: Although all islanders are Bokononists, the actual overt practice of Bokononism was banned on San Lorenzo and punishable by a gruesome death by being skewered by a giant hook. This is all very "Vonnegut".

>"I agree with one Bokononist idea. I agree that all religions, including Bokononism, are nothing but lies.''

And he began the rites and what follows simplified version since in the book each line is repeated twice as it's translated from from Dr. von Koenigswald's German to "Papa'' Monzano's 

>God made mud. 
>God got lonesome. 
>So God said to some of the mud, "Sit up!'' 
>"See all Iâ€™ve made! The sea, the hills, the sky, the stars!'' 
>And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. 
>Lucky me. Lucky mud! 
>I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done. 
>"Nice going, God!'' 
>"Nobody but you could have done it, God.""
> "I certainly couldnâ€™t have!"
>
>"I feel very unimportant compared to you.'' 
>"The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didnâ€™t even get to sit up and look around!"
>"I got so much and most mud got so little." 
>"Thank you for the honor.'' 
>
>"Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep. 
>"What memories for mud to have!"
>"What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!"
>"I loved everything I saw."
>
 "Good night."
 "I will go to heaven now." 
 "I can hardly wait..." 
 "To find out for certain what my *wampeter*[^2] was..." 
 "And who was in my *karass*..."[^3 ]
 "And all the good things our *karass* did for you." 
 "Amen.''

[^2]: A *wampeter* is (loosely) the idea of "what Iâ€™ve (been) manifested here on the planet to do.'' Read more here is you're interested: [[Wampeter]]
[^3]: A *karass* is my team of souls that have (been) manifested to help achieve your *wampeter*. Read more here is you're interested: [[Karass]]

There's wonder at the world we inhabit.

There's gratitude for the chance of having existed in the first place.

There's humility at the unimaginable power that could have created such a world.

There's an acknowledgement and further gratitude for the experiences in the world. Existence seen in this light is privilege and an honour.
