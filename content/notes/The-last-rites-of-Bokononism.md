## The last rites of Bokononism

Throughout the 127 short chapters of Kurt Vonnegut's *Cat's Cradle* our point of view bounces here, then there, and then suddenly, through the narrator's eye's, we're witnessing the the last rites of "Papa'' Monzano, the country's reigning dictator.

Of course, these rites would conform to [[Bokononism is Nothing but Foma|Bokononism]], the native religion of The Republic ofÂ San Lorenzo, a small, fictional island somewhere in the Caribbean.

The only person in the room who volunteered to administer the rites ^[1] was Dr. von Koenigswald, the attending doctor. When asked if he was a Bokononist, he a simply answered:
 [^1]: the actual overt practice of Bokononism was banned and punishable by a gruesome death by being skewered by a giant hook

>"I agree with one Bokononist idea. I agree that all religions, including Bokononism, are nothing but lies.''

And he began the rites and here's simplified version since in the book each line is repeated twice as it's translated from from Dr. von Koenigswald's German to "Papa'' Monzano's 

>God made mud. 
>God got lonesome. 
>So God said to some of the mud, "Sit up!'' 
>"See all Iâ€™ve made! The sea, the hills, the sky, the stars!'' 
>And I was some of the mud that got to sit up and look around. 
>Lucky me. Lucky mud! 
>I, mud, sat up and saw what a nice job God had done. 
>"Nice going, God!'' 
>"Nobody but you could have done it, God.""
> "I certainly couldnâ€™t have!"
>
>"I feel very unimportant compared to you.'' 
>"The only way I can feel the least bit important is to think of all the mud that didnâ€™t even get to sit up and look around!"
>"I got so much and most mud got so little." 
>"Thank you for the honor.'' 
>
>"Now mud lies down again and goes to sleep. 
>"What memories for mud to have!"
>"What interesting other kinds of sitting-up mud I met!"
>"I loved everything I saw."
>
 "Good night."
 "I will go to heaven now." 
 "I can hardly wait..." 
 "To find out for certain what my *wampeter*[^2] was..." 
 "And who was in my *karass*..."[^3 ]
 "And all the good things our *karass* did for you." 
 "Amen.''

[^2]: A *wampeter* is (loosely) the idea of "what Iâ€™ve (been) manifested here on the planet to do.'' Read more here is you're interested: [[Wampeter]]
[^3]: A *karass* is my team of souls that have (been) manifested to help achieve your *wampeter*. Read more here is you're interested: [[Karass]]

This is pure, almost child-like, expression of the attitude we as humans need to have about the miraculous fact of our existence.

There's wonder at the world we inhabit
There's gratitude for the chance of having existed in the first place.
There's humility at the unimaginable power that could have created such a world
There's an acknowledgement and further gratitude for the experiences in the world. Existence seen in this light is privilege and an honor.
