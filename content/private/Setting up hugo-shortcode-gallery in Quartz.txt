Setting up hugo-shortcode-gallery in Quartz
This is the one I used for grantstracks and it worked well. The idea of page bundles isn't used in Quartz, and this one requires it, so this is a bit of an experiment.

And the using the .git method it didn't work. I'm going try again just downloading the code and putting it in the right folder.


Following steps from his github site:
https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery

Create themes folder
clone into the themes folder
git clone https://github.com/mfg92/hugo-shortcode-gallery.git

Next edit your projects config.toml and add this theme component to your themes:

I don't have a theme, so this is it:
theme = ['hugo-shortcode-gallery']

From the gallery author - sample shortcode call - see below for my version.

{{< gallery match="images/*" sortOrder="desc" rowHeight="150" margins="5" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true loadJQuery=true >}}

/Users/grantswilson/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~md~obsidian/Documents/quartz-hugo/themes/hugo-shortcode-gallery/layouts/shortcodes/gallery.html


From Grant's Tracks - so use this because I've tweaked it. But then again, there's not as much room on the Quartz page, so maybe this needs to be tweaked.

NOTE the "loadJQuery=true" is essential, because it forces the JQuery stuff that is part of the image gallery to be loaded.

Image Gallery
{{< gallery match="images/*" sortOrder="asc" rowHeight="200" margins="25" thumbnailResizeOptions="600x600 q90 Lanczos" showExif=true previewType="blur" embedPreview=true loadJQuery=true thumbnailHoverEffect=enlarge lastRow=justify >}}


From here:
https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/

I see that you need to import that module into the site
Example:
[module]
[[module.imports]]
  path = 'github.com/spf13/hyde'

My version - didn't work; does it have to be external?
[module]
[[module.imports]]
  path = '/themes/hugo-shortcode-gallery'

My second try:  - NO ERRORS and IT WORKED!!!!
[module]
[[module.imports]]
  path = 'hugo-shortcode-gallery'


Trying a second time - this time just downloading the code and plunking it in a folder in /themes
